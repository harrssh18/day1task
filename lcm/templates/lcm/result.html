<h1>Result:</h1>
<h3>Step 1: Firstly, find the Prime Factorization of given numbers {{num1}}, {{num2}}<br>
Prime factors of {{num1}} are {{prime_fact1}}. <br>
Prime factorization of {{num1}} in exponent form is: {{num1}} = {{prime_fact1}}<br>
Prime factors of {{num2}} are {{prime_fact2}}. <br>
Prime factorization of {{num2}} in exponent form is: {{num2}} = {{prime_fact2}}
<br><br>
Step 2: Multiply together each of the Prime Numbers with the highest power to obtain the Least Common Multiple<br>
On doing so, you will get the resultant equation as {{l}}= {{lcm}}<br>
Therefore, LCM of two numbers {{num1}} and {{num2}} is {{lcm}}<br>
LCM({{num1}},{{num2}}) = {{lcm}}
